## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **Incremental Development:** Each phase builds upon previous phases with clear validation points
- **Simulation-First:** All physical capabilities developed and tested in simulation before hardware integration
- **Safety-First:** Safety considerations integrated from the beginning, not added later
- **Compatibility-Aware:** v1.4 compatibility maintained throughout development

### Testing Strategy
- **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing at every commit
- **Simulation Testing:** Comprehensive testing in simulated environments
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop:** Gradual integration with real hardware
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Continuous performance monitoring and optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- **Modular Architecture:** Component failures don't cascade to entire system
- **Simulation Framework:** Safe development and testing of physical capabilities
- **Rollback Capabilities:** Ability to revert to v1.4 if needed
- **Comprehensive Safety:** Multiple layers of safety validation and enforcement

This implementation plan transforms Leonidas from a software collaborator into a comprehensive AI platform capable of physical interaction while maintaining the robust architecture and safety principles established in v1.4.
