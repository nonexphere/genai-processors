# Real-time AI System Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing our real-time AI system capabilities, building upon the existing Leonidas project and GenAI Processors library. The goal is to create a comprehensive, production-ready framework for building sophisticated real-time AI applications that can handle multi-modal interactions with low latency, high reliability, and intelligent context management.

The enhancement focuses on five critical areas: context management with transcription optimization, performance optimization, advanced event detection, multi-modal integration, and production-ready architecture patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Context Management & Transcription

**User Story:** As a real-time AI system developer, I want intelligent context management with optimized transcription capabilities, so that my applications can maintain coherent long-running conversations while efficiently managing memory and processing resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation exceeds 80% of the context window THEN the system SHALL automatically compress older context while preserving important information
2. WHEN real-time transcription is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide both input and output transcription with configurable accuracy vs latency trade-offs
3. WHEN context compression occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation continuity and preserve critical information markers
4. WHEN session interruption occurs THEN the system SHALL provide session recovery mechanisms with context restoration
5. IF transcription confidence is below threshold THEN the system SHALL request clarification or use alternative processing paths
6. WHEN processing multi-language content THEN the system SHALL automatically detect language changes and adapt transcription accordingly

### Requirement 2: Real-time Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want comprehensive performance optimization capabilities, so that real-time AI applications can achieve sub-second response times while maintaining high throughput and efficient resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio streams THEN the system SHALL achieve Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) under 500ms for standard requests
2. WHEN handling concurrent sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with connection pooling and load balancing
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement adaptive memory management with automatic cleanup
4. WHEN network latency increases THEN the system SHALL adapt processing strategies to maintain responsiveness
5. IF processing bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL provide automatic scaling and resource optimization
6. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL collect comprehensive metrics including latency, throughput, and resource usage

### Requirement 3: Advanced Event Detection & Interruption Handling

**User Story:** As an AI application developer, I want sophisticated event detection and interruption handling, so that my applications can respond naturally to user interactions and environmental changes while maintaining conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual events are detected THEN the system SHALL classify event types with configurable sensitivity levels
2. WHEN user interruption occurs THEN the system SHALL gracefully stop current generation and switch to user input processing
3. WHEN multiple events occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize events based on configured importance levels
4. WHEN interruption recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL restore appropriate conversation state and context
5. IF event detection confidence is low THEN the system SHALL use fallback detection methods or request confirmation
6. WHEN processing event streams THEN the system SHALL implement debouncing to prevent event spam

### Requirement 4: Multi-modal Integration Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer building multi-modal AI applications, I want seamless integration patterns for audio, video, and text processing, so that I can create rich interactive experiences with synchronized multi-modal understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple modalities THEN the system SHALL synchronize audio, video, and text streams with timestamp alignment
2. WHEN cross-modal context is available THEN the system SHALL share relevant information between processing pipelines
3. WHEN modality-specific processing is needed THEN the system SHALL route content to appropriate specialized processors
4. WHEN streaming multi-modal content THEN the system SHALL maintain stream coherence and handle modality-specific interruptions
5. IF modality processing fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to available modalities
6. WHEN combining modality outputs THEN the system SHALL provide coherent unified responses

### Requirement 5: Production-Ready Architecture

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want production-ready architecture patterns with comprehensive monitoring and reliability features, so that real-time AI systems can be deployed and maintained at scale with high availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards with key performance indicators
3. WHEN alert conditions are met THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications through configurable channels
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load distribution
5. IF critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation
6. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployment strategies

### Requirement 6: Developer Experience & Integration

**User Story:** As a developer integrating real-time AI capabilities, I want comprehensive APIs and documentation, so that I can quickly build and deploy sophisticated real-time AI applications with minimal complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the framework THEN the system SHALL provide high-level APIs that abstract complex real-time processing details
2. WHEN debugging applications THEN the system SHALL offer comprehensive debugging tools and detailed logging
3. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the system SHALL support plugin architecture for extending functionality
4. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN the system SHALL provide adapters for common platforms and protocols
5. IF configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested fixes
6. WHEN learning the framework THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive examples and tutorials

### Requirement 7: Security & Privacy

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want robust security and privacy features, so that real-time AI applications can handle sensitive data safely while complying with privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement end-to-end encryption for all communications
2. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL provide configurable data retention policies with automatic cleanup
3. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication methods including ephemeral tokens
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL implement privacy-preserving logging with PII redaction
5. IF security breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL implement automatic threat response and notification
6. WHEN complying with regulations THEN the system SHALL provide audit trails and compliance reporting features
